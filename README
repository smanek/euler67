Problem: Project Euler #67 http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=67
My general approach is to use simple dynamic programming, to solve simple sub-problems from the bottom up
for example, in the small triangle:
5
9 6
4 6 8
0 7 1 5

I simply note that from the '4' in the third row, '11' is the max sum (max(4+0, 4+7)), 
from the 6, 13 is the max sum (6+7), and from the 8, 13 again is the max sum (8+5) - 
thus simplifying the problem to:
5
9 6
11 13 13

Repeating the same process:
5
22 19

And again:
27

Leaving the trivial problem of a 1-element triangle
